					<p id="big">Hi, I'm Heath!</p> 
					<p>I am a musician, web developer, and animal lover from Holliston, MA, and I am eager and excited to care for your pet!
						Caring for pets has been a passion of mine for as long as I can remember: 
						in a family that loves their pets as much as their children, my life has included animal care every single day.
						I have a true love and appreciation for animals and how much they can improve quality of life.
						I understand the importance your pets hold and that, just like us, they know that companionship has no replacement.
						<br/><br/>
						Dog walking and house sitting has given me the opportunity to extend this passion for animal care to people all around me.
						Whether you have a new puppy who can't be alone for too long, a senior dog that needs extra loving,
						or a cat who could use some company during the day, I am truly so excited to be with them.
						Most importantly, I will always treat your pet as if they were my own.
						<br/><br/>
						I have 6 years of experience in animal care, and while I work mostly with dogs, I have experience caring for
						cats, reptiles, and smaller mammals like hamsters.
						I am comfortable and experienced in walking/running (on- or off-leash), playing, feeding, administering medication, and, of course, loving, pets. 
						If requested, I will send pictures from my time with your pet and I always keep you updated on their health, mood, and behavior.
						<br/><br/>
						I also work through Rover.com and am background-checked through a third-party service, Checkr.
						For more information on background checks and Rover, you can visit my profile
